A GitHub repository for CSE students learning PPL (Principles of Programming Languages). <br />
Please install ANTLR4 (version 4.9.2) and Python (latest version) and follow the instructions to complete these exercises. <br />
The programming languages I will use in this exercise is MT232 (an update version of MT22 in my 222 semester, you can view it here: [PPL-HK222](https://github.com/hieukien503/PPL-HK222)) <br />
Good luck to all of you
